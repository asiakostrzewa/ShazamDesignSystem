## Mission

"Our mission is to help people recognize and engage with the world around them", that's why we provide a tool that recognizes music around our users. It's the best way to discover, explore and share the music that people love.

We are constantly looking for new and innovative ways to delight our users.

## Tone of voice

As a company, we would like to keep things casual and friendly. If Shazam were a person, she/he would be up to date with pop culture, funny and not taking themselves too seriously.

Our content covers our values and style. We use clear and plain language to create messages that users know and direct them where they need to go.

## Values

### Discover and explore <!-- omit in toc -->
We give our users everything they need, instantly. Think about it, you're riding on a tram or in a car and suddenly you hear a song that makes your day. You want to save it so you can go back to that moment.  
This is what we do.

### One team with the user <!-- omit in toc -->
We would like to be like a good friend who recommends a good music playlist, hugs when bad days come and gives energy when the sun rises.  
We all simply know what our user - friend needs.
