## Inclusive language

We don't use words, sentences and tones that reflect stereotypical or discriminatory views about people.  
Treat all people fairly, no matter where they come from or what they do.

### What is inclusive language? <!-- omit in toc -->

Inclusive language is using words and tones that respect everyone and avoid stereotypes or discrimination.  
We prioritize "people-first language". This means focusing on persons, not labels such as gender, race or ability.

### Abilities and disabilities <!-- omit in toc -->

Focus on the person, not their disability.
Don't treat disability as a characteristic of a person.

### Ageism <!-- omit in toc -->

Inclusive language is also sensitive to the entire age range. Terms like "older" and "younger" shouldn't be used in context.  
Avoid terms that limit and categorize. 

### Culture and faith <!-- omit in toc -->

We are a multicultural company, so we should respect cultural values ​​and traditions in our common life.

{: .note } 
Avoid using words related to religion.  
Try not to use language that focuses only on the culture's values and traditions or that creates divisions between different groups.

### Race <!-- omit in toc -->

Avoid emphasizing differences between people. Don't stereotype or make generalizations.

### Sexism <!-- omit in toc -->

Use gender neutral language. Don’t use sexual references.

### Vulgar language <!-- omit in toc -->

Don't use profanity as it may cause offense. If you're referring to song title that contains vulgar language, then use [quote rules](https://asiakostrzewa.github.io/ShazamDesignSystem/docs/Branding.html#quotes-).
