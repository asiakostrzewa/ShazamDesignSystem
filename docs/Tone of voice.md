### Tone of voice

As a company, we would like to keep things casual and friendly. If Shazam were a person, she/he would be up to date with pop culture, funny and not taking themselves too seriously.

Our content covers our values and style. We use clear and plain language to create messages that users know and direct them where they need to go.
