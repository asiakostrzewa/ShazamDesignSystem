## Logo

A logo is a visual representation of our brand. It can be a word mark, an icon, or a combination of both. 

![Shazam logo explanation](./links/Shazam_logo_expl.png)

The goal is always to proudly project our brand, but without overdoing it. So when the users see our products, they immediately recognize our brand.

### Logo options

The Shazam logo is available in two colors: blue and gray. The blue version is dedicated to a light theme. The gray version should be used on dark theme.

| Light theme logo icons | Dark theme logo icons |
